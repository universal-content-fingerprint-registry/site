# Overview

This section provides comprehensive guides for working with the Universal Content Fingerprinting Registry (UCFR) system.

## Overview

The UCFR allows creators to establish verifiable authorship through cryptographic fingerprints and an on-chain registry. This section covers everything you need to know to start using the system effectively.

## What You'll Learn

- **Core Concepts**: Understanding claims, method IDs, external IDs, and how the system works
- **Content Hashing**: How to properly hash different types of content and generate consistent fingerprints
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Complete examples of interacting with the GeneralizedClaimRegistry contract
- **Best Practices**: Security considerations, gas optimization, and error handling
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world scenarios including document timestamping and verification

## Getting Started

Choose the guide that best fits your needs:

1. **[Core Concepts](./concepts)** - Essential understanding of claims, method IDs, and external IDs
2. **[Content Hashing](./hashing)** - Practical examples of hashing content and creating claims
<!-- 3. **[The Smart Contract](./smart-contract)** - Comprehensive reference for all contract methods and setup procedures -->

All guides include working code examples and cover essential topics like error handling, verification, and optimization techniques.
